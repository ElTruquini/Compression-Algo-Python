# Compression-Algo-Python

The	project	will	be	code	for	a	lossless	data	
compressor.	The	complete	data	compressor	will	combine	three	distinct	processing	
original phases.	This	assignment	tackles	the	first	phase.	
In	a	nutshell,	data	compression	algorithms	attempt	to	exploit	data	redundancy	
all-rotations within	a	file	in	order	to	create	an	encoding	of	the	file	smaller	than	the	original.	For	
example,	a	sequence	of	repeated	characters	can	be	replaced	by	one	instance	of	the	character	followed	by	a	code	indicating	the	number	of	repeats	(i.e.,	run-length encoding).	The	character	plus	code	can	often	be	smaller	(sometimes	much	smaller)	
than	the	original	sequence	of	characters.	Lossless	data	compressors	(such	as	Unix compress,	zip,	gzip,	bzip2,	etc.)	ensure	the	original	file	can	always	be	recovered	from the	smaller	encoding.
